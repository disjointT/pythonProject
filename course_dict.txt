It includes tools of both financial and managerial accounting. Unit 1 focuses on the financial reports and analysis of the financial position and the operating results of business organizations. You will learn several techniques such as common sizing, trend analysis and ratio analysis to help you analyze an organization for which you have no information except the annual published financial report. Exam #1 will be given at the end of Unit 1. The second part of the course, Unit 2, looks at the financial reports of organizations in the private (non-government) not-for-profit sector. We will compare and contrast the reporting and analysis of these NPOs with that of businesses, and discuss the needs for different information and performance measures in the private not-for-profits. Exam #2 will be given at the end of Unit 2. In the last unit, Unit 3, we look at organizations not as an outsider (investor, donor, creditor), but instead as a manager inside the organization. You will learn how to use several financial tools available to managers such as budgets, decision making tools, and break even analysis, and how to predict or measure the financial impact of different alternatives. This is often referred to as managerial accounting. The final exam covers the material in Unit 3.$}
90-725={Title:Management Accounting$Units:6$Description:Information provided by external financial reporting (financial statements) is compiled too late to be actionable to change an organizations performance, it is also too aggregated for managers to use in making strategic decisions.$}

We will set our analysis in the context of a review of the historic development of cities. After an overview of early history, we will concentrate on late 19th and 20th century city development. We will examine the series of post war government and private sector policies that supported anti urban trends that led to current urban patterns. The course will conclude with a discussion of policies and remedies that can support sustainable urban growth. The course will concentrate on the physical, geographical and built aspects of cities -- the "public realm", the spaces we all share -- but it will also address the relation between the physical nature of cities and the quality of community that develops. In addition to class discussions, students will be asked to develop an independent brief research project that explores in depth one of the aspects of the course content. Student presentations of their research will be used to augment class discussions.$}
90-736={Title:Public Finance$Units:12$Description:The purpose of Public Finance (90-736/90-435) is to provide an introduction to the theory and practice of how national, regional and local governments should and actually finance their budgets for operating and capital project purposes. To accomplish this, the course reviews: i] rationales for government intervention in the market place, ii] analyzes methods of resolving conflicts over the size of the public sector budget, iii] extensively analyzes the rationales and issues of various types of tax revenue, and iv] reviews the effects of public sector spending and taxes on the aggregate economy. Throughout, Public Finance emphasizes the interplay between how current revenue policy is fashioned, and how the models and their key assumptions along with political processes interact which result in changes in current law at the federal, state, and local levels. While the examples are largely drawn from the United States, examples are also drawn from around the world. Because the subject matter of public spending and revenues can easily consume an entire academic year of study, Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss in the Spring build on Public Finance. Public Expenditure Analysis (90-774/90-474) deals with techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Education Finance and Policy (90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance from US and international perspectives.$}

What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable?$}
90-747={Title:Cost Benefit Analysis$Units:6$Description:As public policy analysts, we are often presented with making decisions that are economically efficient – that is, how does one gain the most benefit for society, given limited resources? Economics provides the theoretical foundation of decision-making, but putting theory into practice is not always easy. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an analytical tool used to determine the worth of a project, program, or policy. It identifies and attempts to quantify the costs and benefits of the project or program and provides decision-makers with manageable information to find the “best” outcome. CBA helps managers to answer questions such as: • Does the proposal provide a net benefit to the community as a whole? • Should the project/program/policy be undertaken? • Should the project/program be continued? • Which of the alternative projects should be undertaken? The course employs various economic and statistical techniques to answer these questions, condensed into a 6-week course.$}

Students will learn why the engagement process is valued in a democratic society, practiced locally, and how it is currently transforming to be more effective. While there are no right answers to effective civic engagement, the content and participatory role-playing will introduce students to the complexity of engagement issues, responsibilities, and hands-on facilitation experience to achieve better outcomes for citizens, communities, and practices for community decision and policymaking. New topics will be introduced on a weekly basis through student-led presentations and facilitated discussions. All students will be responsible for weekly reading and annotation assignments, selecting and leading at least one topic presentation and discussion, and submitting in-depth research and analysis based on their presentation topic as an end-of-term final paper. Assessment of individual performance will be based on weekly reading and annotation assignments, class participation, topic presentation and discussion facilitation, and the final paper. There will be no final exam.$}

90-807={Title:Planning by Design: Campuses, Waterfronts, Districts, and Cities$Units:12$Description:The focus of this seminar is the connection between design decisions and urban development, and how a better understanding of this relationship will contribute to knowledge, policy and practice of a robust and forward-looking contemporary urbanism. The seminar draws on the instructor's research, teaching, and practice including current projects, focusing on urban design and planning current projects relevant to international, North American, and Pittsburgh perspectives. The course is divided into three units: The Campus in Context; Waterfronts in Transition, and Districts and Design--how urban districts achieve and sustain a meaningful density of interaction and opportunity, and the role of architecture, design, and arts in that achievement. These built environments is that they test the capacity of architecture and development to propose meaningfully complex and resilient program and form, from city centers to polycentric regions. The seminar will address how the design and planning of campuses, waterfronts, and specific "districts" can build up--or tear down--a robust urbanism: to better understand the decisions that can lead to an urbanism that is experientially stimulating, architecturally rich, local and global, and diverse and deep enough for the long term. Each unit will be four weeks, with Campus and Waterfronts completed before Spring Break, the third, Districts, follows, and the semester ends with the final two weeks focused on a synthesizing research project and presentations.$}
90-808={Title:Energy Policy$Units:6$Description:This seminar will provide an introduction to modern U.S. energy policy. Our goal will be to understand, from a practical perspective, how economics, technology, politics, public opinion and national security all influence the development and implementation of policy. Questions that we will address include: Why has energy and the environment taken on such a critical role in the public policy agenda? How has U.S. energy policy changed over the years and what lessons have we learned from past initiatives? How much influence does government really have? How have new technologies changed the energy landscape and our interactions with other countries? The class will begin with an overview of the energy sector and the related government structure. After covering some historical context, we will discuss Presidential initiatives and legislative activity. We will then consider some case studies, such as the Keystone Pipeline, the development of the Marcellus Shale, and carbon pricing that demonstrate conflicting viewpoints about appropriate energy policy. The class will also explore international energy security issues like liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports. This course is a seminar class; I will provide a framework and then guide a discussion among the students. Your preparation and participation are essential. Each session will begin with a short review and discussion of current events in the energy sector, including how energy and environmental issues are being addressed in the November elections. We will also hear from guest speakers, including a number of current and former senior government officials.$}
90-810={Title:Social Movements$Units:3$Description:Both in the U.S. and in other societies, social movements have been at the forefront of economic and political change. In this micro course, we will explore the complex nature of social movements, the potential impacts of movements, the elements that influence the movement’s success, and the relationship between movements and institutions, including the policy and political effects of selected movements. The course will include lectures, class discussions, and presentations by guest speakers.$}

90-822={Title:Critical Analysis of Policy Research$Units:6$Description:This course prepares students to understand, interpret, and critique existing policy research. The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation.$}
90-823={Title:Program Evaluation$Units:12$Description:Pre-Requisite(s): 90-711 or 90-786. In all parts of the world, from the local to the global level, governments, funding agencies, organizations, and individuals are involved in activities meant to improve some aspect of people’s lives – disaster relief in Haiti, human rights work in Sierra Leone, increasing school attendance in Detroit or improving outcomes for IV drug users in Barcelona, the list is long and ever changing. The needs addressed by these programs are often compelling and the programs themselves can be innovative, practical, and inspired. From those running and funding social programs to those whose needs are meant to be addressed by these programs a central question arises: Does this social program work? In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the program's design and implementation, and ultimately the program’s impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the program’s merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making. Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading. This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.$}

90-825={Title:Innovation Management in Practice$Units:-1$Description:Innovation has been described as the intersection of invention and insight leading to the creation of social and economic value. Companies increasingly rely on innovation to establish and drive their success. Public policy makers see innovation as a critical driver for economic development. This course is an opportunity to learn about innovation management from those in the front lines. How are innovation opportunities identified? What are the challenges to realizing these opportunities and how can the challenges be addressed? What roles are played by processes technologies and the business environment as well as by individuals in organizations? This course will feature speakers who drive innovation in a variety of settings paired with readings from the innovation literature that will help frame the presentations and discussion.$}
90-832={Title:Health Law$Units:6$Description:This course introduces students to the laws that impact the provision of health care services. With the increasing intersection between health care and the law, executives and others involved in the administration and delivery of health care services are likely to encounter a wide range of legal and regulatory issues, particularly as the fate of the Affordable Care Act is debated. This course is designed to provide students with the practical knowledge needed to identify legal issues inherent in health care and to understand the legal ramifications of administrative and management decisions. Specific course topics include: sources of law, the US court system and legal procedures, professional and institutional liability, governmental regulatory methods, antitrust law, fraud laws, corporate compliance programs, issues concerning informed consent, credentialing of medical professionals, termination of care, and health care reform. Upon completion of this course the student should be able to: 1. Explain the US legal system and sources of law in the United States. 2. Recognize and apply laws, regulations, and policies that govern the administration and delivery of health care services. 3. Identify potential legal ramifications of health care management and administrative decisions. 4. Identify issues that warrant seeking the assistance of legal counsel.$}
90-833={Title:Population Health$Units:6$Description:It is a societal imperative that we improve the quality of health for all Americans while reducing the cost. In so doing, we must move from a reactionary, disease driven, hospital-dominated model to one that creates the appropriate level of incentives and health delivery infrastructure so that patients embrace strategies to prevent disease and promote healthy living and behavior. What is Population Health and what role do individuals, executive branch agencies, and non-profits play in the protection and promotion of positive health outcomes? How are health outcomes assessed? In this introductory course, we will examine the way health care delivery systems, public health agencies, community-based organizations, and many other entities work together to develop interventions to improve the health outcomes in the local, national, and global communities they serve. We will first learn to examine health issues from a population health perspective.$}
90-834={Title:Health Care Geographical Information Systems$Units:12$Description:A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical record data, social services, and other location data. Public health departments, hospitals, and medical research agencies are using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It imbeds learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes lectures and computer labs that focus on a health, technical, or policy issue which use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create Story Maps to convey their maps and associated text to the public and decision makers. Through assignments and projects students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health care organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health data.

90-847={Title:Grand Corruption and Rule of Law$Units:6$Description:This course will address the implementation challenges facing international anti-corruption agreements, notably the UN Convention against Corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. Getting signatory countries' laws and regulations to be consonant with the provisions of these conventions is only the first stage of what is, in fact, a two-stage implementation process. The second stage is the enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations. This stage, which fosters deterrence and strengthens the rule of law vital to economic development, will be the focus of the course. The course will examine cases of grand corruption across the world, including in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Among the countries to be covered will be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and others. The course will discuss different strategies and solutions that leaders in governments, non-government organisations and private sector can consider to improve, at a global level, the implementation of UNCAC and OECD anti-bribery convention. At the national level, the course will discuss and develop recommendations to enhance the enforcement of anti-corruption laws in terms of effective detection, investigation, prosecution and sanctions against corruption, with due consideration to different country contexts.$}

Classes include group discussions as well as engagement with former policymakers who worked inside government to make change happen and advocates who helped propel policy changes from outside government. $}
90-860={Title:Policy in a Global Economy$Units:12$Description:From the dawn of the New Deal through the presidency of Barack Obama, the U.S. led the development of an open, global system of relatively free trade and global capital flows. In the current political environment, leaders on both the American political left (like Senator Bernie Sanders) and the political right (like Donald Trump), have called into question this bipartisan consensus in favor of freer trade and investment. That turn away from globalization has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Was the earlier pro-globalizationconsensus wrong? Is globalization good or bad for the U.S. economy? What are the impacts of globalization on the rest of the world?  How has economic globalization impacted the environment and income inequality in the U.S. and around the world? This course provides future policy makers and managers with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to understand economic globalization and its effects. These issues will be studied using the analytical tools and concepts of international economics. Guest lectures and case studies will provide a range of perspectives on current policy debates. The course will also examine science-based policies that could maximize the benefits and minimize the disruption generated by globalization. The fall 2020 version of the course will examine the global macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which international policy coordination -- or lack thereof -- worsened that impact.$}
90-861={Title:Health Policy$Units:6$Description:This course introduces students to the concepts, theories, and tools of health policy. The aims of this course are to provide students with (1) the ability to identify key problems facing the United States health system, (2) increase the appreciation for and understanding of health policy as an important and useful tool for enhancing population health, and (3) mechanisms to address a current health policy issue from legal, economic, behavioral, and political perspectives. In addition, students will be introduced to a cross-national comparison of health systems.$}
90-871={Title:Policy and Gender Workshop$Units:3$Description:While other courses examine policies that disproportionately impact women, this "micro" course will look at an range of current policy issues and explore the previously under-examined gender aspects, and impacts, of these policies. Students will be exposed to research and various tools used to conduct gender analyses. Using a foundational understanding of gender analysis, students will review current policy proposals, analyze and report on how gender plays a role in the policy implementation, and make recommendations to improve the proposals so that they will achieve greater gender equality.$}
90-872={Title:Using R for Policy Data Analysis$Units:6$Description:Data analysis is an essential part of quantitative policy analysis; however, focused application of statistical methods is outside of the scope of what can be taught in classes such as Cost –Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Program Evaluation. In this course, students who will apply a variety of data analysis techniques using R, a free open source statistics and graphical analysis environment that is increasingly used by data miners and analysts. Class sessions will include a combination of instruction on data analysis techniques, in-class application using R, and presentations by practicing policy data analysts. Applications will focus on analysis that is relevant to the social safety net, including cases that focus on consumer protection, affordable housing and homelessness.$}
90-874={Title:Special Topics: Principles & Practices of R&D Management$Units:6$Description:This course considers key issues and trade-off in R&D strategy and organization, paying attention to dynamic competitive contexts where technology plays a key role. These topics are treated assuming the perspective of the decision maker. It addresses typical problems of large, medium and small firms having a structured R&D and operating businesses where R&D is the source of competitive advantages. Although we will heavily focus on R&D, emphasis is placed on viewing R&D as a part (although, a key part) of the process of technological innovation; therefore, as an activity to be strongly and appropriately integrated with other functions to make innovation successful.$}
90-882={Title:Behavioral Economics in Public Policy$Units:12$Description:Economics has up to now been the social science that has been most broadly and deeply involved in public policy. With its rational choice perspective, the economic perspective has tended to favor certain types of policies, namely those that enhance the efficiency of market mechanisms and lower the cost of information. In this course we will spend the first several classes reviewing the assumptions, implications for public policy, and limitations of the rational choice perspective. The remainder of the course will then be devoted to examining different public policy issues, including saving, health care, crime and drug abuse, through the competing lenses of traditional and behavioral economics.$}
90-883={Title:Democracy, Human Rights and Sustainable Development in the 21st Century$Units:6$Description:This course explores how advancing democracy and human rights around the world has evolved in the 21st century with a particular focus on the impact of technology.

90-908={Title:Ph.D. Microeconomics$Units:12$Description:This course provides a semester-long introduction to microeconomic analysis and its application. The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students' ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues and more generally to help students acquire formal modeling skills -- the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations. This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper. There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, students are assumed to have a solid working knowledge of multivariate calculus. You will take a brief math quiz in the first lecture to help you determine whether your math training is sufficient for the course. Prior exposure to microeconomics, in a good undergraduate-level course, is helpful but not required.$}

91-819={Title:Optimization and Risk Modeling for Managers$Units:6$Description:This course has four objectives besides learning a variety of spreadsheet skills. First, you should learn about a variety of management science techniques, what they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. Second, you should acquire sufficient proficiency with some of the techniques that you can use them as an “end user modeler”. Third, you should learn how to approach, abstract, and analyze problems from a quantitative, analytical perspective. In short, you should be able to use the language of mathematical modeling. In most lectures we will work through a small “case” to help you connect the methods to a problem that is richer than the typical end of chapter problem. Fourth, doing these things will prepare you to manage staff who are doing analytics projects. Walking a mile in their shoes (reflectively), will help you understand what they can and cannot do to create value for your organization. The course moves quickly; be careful not to fall behind. Unless I explicitly say otherwise, always read the assigned readings before the class in which they are discussed; failing to do so is the most common reason for failing the course.$}
91-820={Title:Strategic Planning$Units:12$Description:This course emphasizes strategic planning processes and focusses on setting strategic objectives and developing strategies for implementing those objectives. The course teaches students the building blocks of strategic planning and introduces students to the contested theories of how to develop and implement plans. The content of the course includes exploring the basic concepts used in strategic planning; distinguishing between operational matters (organisational effectiveness) and strategic matters (leadership); analysing the organisations internal and external environments; and achieving alignment between them. A considerable amount of time is spent on developing skills to frame issues correctly so that strategic plans address the organisation's true needs. Finally, the course addresses implementation issues, particularly those requiring change management. Students are encouraged to draw upon skills acquired in other areas, such as finance, marketing, organization management etc. in formulating the strategic plan. The assignments includes students forming teams of 4-6, with each team working on a strategic planning project with a Government agency or not-for-profit organization based in South Australia. The actual projects are sourced by the course instructor with students being able to lodge expressions of interest for their preferred project.$}

94-802={Title:Geographic Information Systems$Units:12$Description:Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are information systems specifically designed to store and analyze geographic data. GIS represents almost all elements on the earth, such as roadways, rivers, utilities, cities, mountains, natural resources, energy infrastructure and so forth. GIS is used to visualize, analyze and compute the data about the world and human activities. What makes GIS different from other IS is that the data is stored and visualized on a map. The spatial analysis on the map reveals unique patterns in the geographic scope, which is the main advantage over table or text based data representation.$}
94-803={Title:Consulting Lab$Units:6$Description:Communication is the glue that holds consulting engagements, teams, and relationships together. Arguably, the better a consultant you are, the better a communicator you are, and the best communicators tend to make very good consultants (nice symmetry there). Poor communication and other 'soft skills' can derail a consulting engagement and with it, a promising consulting career. As an example, a Gartner Group study found that 80% of all IT projects were late, over budget, or failed completely because of poor communication at the outset. This course will help students interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from personal branding to asking high-value, incisive questions to building strong, long-term client relationships$}

Are the survey results flawed by inappropriate survey design & methods? This course introduces you to a set of principles & methods in survey design that are the based on the scholarship that informs best practices in the field. We will use the concept of total survey error to frame an understanding of the key issues in survey research, including sampling frames, survey statistics, modes of data collection, non-response, question structure, wording, context & other important features of survey administration & data collection. By developing your own survey, you will examine the major decisions faced by a professional who wants to design & administer high-quality surveys. The course will focus heavily on class discussion of readings, in-class group work & a survey design project. For this reason, attendance & active participation are important for successful learning in this course. I want to turn you into a Survey Snob. I know this sounds odd, but I want you to become a sophisticated & critical consumer & producer of surveys. To accomplish this, you will need to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of survey research & design. After this course, I hope that you look at surveys through a new set of eyes. You will be able to distinguish poorly-constructed surveys from well-constructed surveys.

95-884={Title:Network Defenses$Units:6$Description:Network Defenses will cover the basics of network security through lecture and hands-on interaction with live virtual systems. Topics and labs include network traffic analysis, firewalls, networking, intrusion detection systems, logging and system event management, and network flow. The course will culminate in a group exercise where teams will identify and detect live attacks occurring on a virtual environment. Network Defenses is geared towards students who may be non-technical by nature, but who want to gain hands-on insight into the tools and techniques used in network security and computer security in general. However, no prior hands-on skills are required in order to succeed in this course. Course concepts will be tested via weekly quizzes and a final exam.$}
95-885={Title:Data Science and Big Data$Units:12$Description:From empirical, to theoretical, to computational science, we are at the dawn of a new revolution---a fourth paradigm of science driven by data. Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present? How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations. The real excitement of data science is in the doing. This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools. Comfort in the Pythonic way of thinking is required as demonstrated by a graded of C or better in one or more of the following courses: 95-880 Python for Developers 95-888 Data Focused Python 95-828 Machine Learning for Problem Solving 95-865 Unstructured Data Analytics If you've taken 15-688 Practical Data Science, due to the significant overlap in these classes, we will not be able to register you for 95-885.$}
95-888={Title:Data Focused Python$Units:6$Description:This seven-week course focuses on the fundamentals of computer programming using the Python 3 interpreted programming language. Students will develop their problem-solving skills using the top-down procedural decomposition approach to build real-world based software applications. Pupils will also learn the basics of the software development lifecycle: planning, development, testing, implementation and maintenance. Assignments will include weekly homework and bi-weekly fundamental checkpoint quizzes, top-down approach programming projects within a capstone object-oriented data focused project. Learners will study how to build professional, user-friendly computer programs applicable to realworld applications in an IT-modeled environment.$}
95-889={Title:Applied Threat Analysis$Units:6$Description:Cyber Threat Analysts fuse several data types to provide industry and government with strategic analysis for decision makers. There is a strong need for students to develop the capability to understand cyber threats and provide actionable intelligence. This course deconstructs what governments and industry define as cyber threats by providing students with a deep understanding of vulnerabilities, exploits, malware, network communications, and actors. In addition to expanding the knowledge base of threats, the course expands the technical understanding of indicators of compromise.$}
95-891={Title:Introduction to Artificial Intelligence$Units:12$Description:Driven by the combination of increased access to data, computational power, and improved sensors and algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are entering the mainstream of technological innovation.
